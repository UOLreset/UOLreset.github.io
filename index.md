# University of Leicester ReSET Service

The University of Leicester's ReSET (Research Software Engineering Team) offer software engineering expertise to researchers.

We periodically put out a call for applications for RSE (Research Software Engineer) time. Applications can be made by completing the questionnaire [here](https://leicester.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/reset "Application Questionnaire").

ReSET projects typically consist of around 3 months' work. Both funded and unfunded projects are welcome to apply for time.

We encourage those writing grant applications that rely on RSE time to contact us during the grant application writing stage, in order to discuss the help we can provide, and inform the costings at application time.

The ReSET team can be contacted at XXX.
