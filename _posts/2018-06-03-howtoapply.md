## How to apply
Perhaps you have an idea for a new project, or you have a code that runs too slowly for your liking. If so, we'd like to hear from you! We periodically put out a call for applications for RSE (Research Software Engineer) time. Applications can be made by completing the questionnaire [here](https://leicester.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/reset "Application Questionnaire").

ReSET projects typically consist of around 3 months' work, depending on the required effort. Both funded and unfunded projects are welcome to apply for time.

We encourage those writing grant applications for projects that will rely on RSE time to contact us during the grant application writing stage, in order to discuss the help we can provide, and inform the costings at application time.
